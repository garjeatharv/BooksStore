# BooksStore
The BookStore API is a Node.js application built with Express and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API to manage books in a bookstore. With this API, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records, including fetching all books, fetching a book by ID, and creating a new book.
